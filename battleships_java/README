Play classic battleships against the computer. 
You have to place the ships in the 1st phase so they don't touch each other
(even diagonally). After placing all of them, 2nd place starts where you
are trying to sink all your enemy's ships. After sinking a one, use right button
to mark all positions around to avoid empty firings.
