## Script selection

Selection of scripts I was writing since 2002 that might be somehow useful.
Or at least demontration of my no-lifer childhood. Folder names should
be self-explanatory. No new code from at least 5 last years is here as I became
slave of the commercial world and writing only disclosed code since then.

Since you are probably not coming from LinkedIn, neither
you are an agency trying to sell me their great opportunity in cutting-edge
SalesForce startup corporate, feel free to write me at jakub.vonsovsky@gmail.com
to discuss any potential cooperation. I specialize in Machine Learning (esp. computer
vision) now. Because it's cool and my AI degrees are not wasted in vain.
Or we can just have a beer if you are somewhere around Central Europe.
