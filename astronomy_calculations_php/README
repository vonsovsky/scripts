# Astronomy calculations

Astronomical calculations as part of my bachelor thesis: https://is.muni.cz/th/uhbsu/

## What it does
It can calculate sunset and sunrise time for any given location at any
given date. It shows positions of planets or selected stars on the night sky at
any given time. Or shows moon phase.
Earth precession and nutation is taken into account.

## How to use
Application should be copied to any folder where web server reads data.

## Troubleshooting
If generating png of images doesn't work, it's because of first line 
`#!/packages/run/php/bin/php` in includes/map.php and includes/moonphase.png.
You can just delete it.
